✅ Project Description

I am currently working on a project in QapMap, a platform used to manage cap tables—documents that outline a company’s ownership structure, listing all shareholders and their respective ownership percentages.
We assist startups by providing a detailed view of their ESOPs and equity. Stakeholders can include both investors and employees.
The platform supports features like:
1. Share buybacks
2. Vesting
3. render
3. Exercise of equity awards

✅ Tech Stack and One-Liner Benefits
1. C# / .NET: A modern, high-performance framework for building scalable, maintainable backend services.
2. Event Store: Enables reliable event sourcing by storing the full history of state changes for auditability and traceability.
3. MongoDB: A flexible NoSQL database ideal for handling dynamic and hierarchical data structures like cap tables.
4. AutoMapper: Simplifies object-to-object mapping, reducing boilerplate code in DTO conversions.
5. CQRS Pattern: Separates read and write logic for better performance, scalability, and maintainability.
6. Docker: Provides lightweight containers for consistent development, testing, and deployment across environments.
7. NServiceBus: Handles asynchronous messaging and distributed workflows for resilient and decoupled microservices.

✅ Event Store vs MongoDB

We use Event Store for writes and MongoDB for reads to implement the CQRS pattern.

Benefits:
1. Event Store captures every change as an immutable event for auditability and traceability.
2. MongoDB is optimized for fast, flexible reads.
3. Improves overall system performance by decoupling read and write operations.
4. Enables independent scaling of reads and writes.
5. Increases system resilience and maintainability.


✅ Why do you want to switch jobs? (Answer for 5 years of experience, with last company being the only one)
“I’ve had a great learning journey in my current company, where I’ve grown both technically and professionally. 
Over the last few years, I’ve worked on complex systems using technologies like .NET, Event Sourcing, CQRS, and distributed 
architecture, and I’m proud of the impact I’ve made.
However, I feel ready for a new challenge—something that pushes me further, exposes me to different problem spaces, and gives me the
opportunity to grow in areas like system design, architecture decisions, or even leadership.
I’m looking for an environment where I can continue to learn, work with smart people, and contribute to meaningful projects at scale.”
